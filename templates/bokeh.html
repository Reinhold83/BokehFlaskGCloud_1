 <div  style = "margin: 10px" 'justify'>
    The housing market in Ireland has been facing very distinct curves in the past two decades along with a big recession that reached its peak in 2008 to a descending curve since,
    by 2013 the housing market started to reverse to a positive growth, although this positive variance has not been strong enough to solve the crisis as the analyses has shown, yet this is not a real portrait of the issue, as a majority of the tenants are not officially registered in The Private Tenancies Board(PRTB). From the analyses of the Census of 2016 the CSO has concluded that there are 2.48 people per private property in Dublin City, although news as “Fifteen people sharing one room in house with 70 tenants” in Dublin City from the Independent.ie in 2017 are actually not as alarming.
    As it is a market the analyses and visualization will be divided between supply and demand using Python 3 with Jupyter Notebook, pandas, numpy, Bokeh, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask among others to find insights to support a solution to the issue.
